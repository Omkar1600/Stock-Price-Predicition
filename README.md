1.To execute the project you should have all python packages in requirments.txt file

2.For running the jupyer file you show have a jupyter environment setup in your system for doing so folloe the steps in the link below
link :https://jupyter.org/install

3.After the setup of envionment create folder for your project

4.Download LSTM jupyter notebook and app.py file in that folder

5.Using jupyter notebook navigate to Lstm file and run all the cells of the file

6.YOur model is saved in your folder 

7.With any of the code editor navigate to the project folder and then the terminal run the command below
command : streamlit run app.py

Your project will be running on localhoast on your browser.

Explanation about LSTM 

Long Short Term Memory Network is an advanced RNN, a sequential network, that allows information to persist. It is capable of handling the vanishing gradient problem faced by RNN. A recurrent neural network is also known as RNN is used for persistent memory.

Letâ€™s say while watching a video you remember the previous scene or while reading a book you know what happened in the earlier chapter. Similarly RNNs work, they remember the previous information and use it for processing the current input. The shortcoming of RNN is, they can not remember Long term dependencies due to vanishing gradient. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid long-term dependency problems.
